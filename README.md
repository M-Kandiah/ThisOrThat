# What is This Or That?

This Or That is an android app whereby players must compete to see how similar their decisions are with the general publics...They will be faced with numerous tricky options and must choose which they would prefer; those who luckily choose the majority opinion, well done. For the others however, the outlook is not so pretty.

# Motivation

The motivation for this project was initally my facination with how android app development works. I thought it was always something that was taken for granted since we use android apps everyday. This luckily coincided with my want to learn a new programming languages and, more specifically, to develop my skills and understanding in OOP and to practise in a language which has that paradigm at its focus.
